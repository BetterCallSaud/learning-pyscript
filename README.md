# Learning PyScript
## A little about PyScript
PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTMLâ€™s interface. PyScript aims to give users a first-class programming language that has consistent styling rules, is more expressive, and is easier to learn.

## Requirements
+ Internet browser (only works for Google Chrome as of April 2022)
+ PIP installed on the local system, so you can install the required packages to run the clone

## About the repository
This repository will contain all my work (examples) and projects on PyScript.
